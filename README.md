This repo contains the final project I did in my networks class in the summer 2023 semester. 
It is a client and server which sends linux commands to be executed and runs said commands, respectively.
I was the one who created the client program, while my partner made the server. I also wrote the report.
Both programs used multithreading to send/run multiple commands at a time.
